# Testing Multiple Ways of Doing CI on GitHub
This repository contains an example project that demonstrates how to test multiple ways of doing Continuous Integration (CI) on GitHub. The project has a simple library that adds two numbers together, and includes tests written using three different frameworks: Mocha, Jest, and Node.js's built-in assert module. The project also includes a GitHub Actions workflow that runs the tests on every push to the repository. The workflow is configured to run the tests using all three frameworks. The workflow is defined in the file `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
